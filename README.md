On `ai-celeste.github.io`, you can use `Microsoft Copilot` for free unlimited times.

In the future, we will add markdown parsing functionality to achieve better visual presentation of Copilot's answers.

After running out of 10 chances to answer, you don't need to spend money. You only need to refresh the webpage, and the number of answers will return to 10 times. You can also add "? Op=100000" after the URL of this online AI website, where the value of "op" is the number of available answers.

The Microsoft Bing Copilot API called in the code is deployed on another registered (under Chinese government supervision) server. You can use it with complete confidence.

Addendum: ChatGPT 3.5/4o-mini's chat service will be launched soon, welcome to experience it.

### `The interface may experience instability recently, please forgive me.`
